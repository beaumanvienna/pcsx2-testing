== How To Update PCSX2 Docs == 

Source Directory: ./pcsx2/pcsx2/Docs 
Release Directory: /pcsx2/bin/Docs 

Docs should be written in the source directory first in an easily editable
format. Currently, Markdown is the preferred format due to its simple markup and
easy portability. GitHub's built-in preview functions are a huge benefit as 
well.

Visual Studio Code is a cross platform text editor/development platform that can
handle Markdown syntax, plus extensions are available to enable in-editor
previewing and PDF generation. However, this is not a requirement since other
editors will support Markdown, and worst case GitHub supports editing Markdown
files in-browser.

Once docs are finished, convert them from Markdown to PDFs using the tool of
your choice. Move the PDFs to the above Release Directory.
